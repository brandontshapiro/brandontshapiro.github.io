		    My research uses combinatorial and categorical techniques to study a wide range of objects in topology, geometry, algebra, and the sciences in a visual way that supports generalizations and connections between different subjects. I like to say I play with shapes all day, and in one way or another all of my work really boils down to sticking together various shapes in various patterns for various purposes. Below are descriptions of my papers organized by the several different topics I work on: <a href="#geometry">categorical geometry</a> projects with undergraduates, <a href="#ktheory">combinatorial K-theory</a>, <a href="#higher">higher categorical structures</a>, and <a href="#applied">applied category theory</a>, and further down are some <a href="#talks">talks</a> I've given and <a href="#older">older projects</a>.

		    Hyperbolic and Euclidean tilings of the plane provide beautiful examples of spaces built up out of cells of fixed shapes, similar to the decompositions of spaces common in geometric and algebraic topology. The categorical models of combinatorial spaces used in algebraic topology ("presheaves") can also model tilings, but doing so requires choices of directions and labels that form a rich theory accessible to undergraduate researchers.

				Introduces "m-gon categories" whose presheaves are arrangements of vertices, directed edges, and labeled m-gon tiles with a fixed pattern of edge directions, and counts the number of these categories up to rotation and reflection of the m-gon. Defines "directed tilings" which are presheaves on an m-gon category corresponding to an m-gon tiling of the plane, and shows that any directed tiling with n m-gons at each vertex can be recovered from any single such directed tiling by reversing edges in a particular way. Constructs a large family of directed tilings using modified reflections of tiles, with elegant symmetry properties.

			Algebraic K-theory builds a group-like space which describes how various types of objects are built up out of smaller pieces, where "smaller" is tracked by certain morphisms in a category. My work builds on an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08014" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08014'); return false;"><strong>axiomatic framework</strong></a> for K-theory called "CGW categories" which uses double categories to model a wide range of objects with two different ways of mapping a smaller object to a bigger one. One way this plays out is by treating "combinations" of objects like extensions A &rarr; B &rarr; C of modules or complementary inclusions A &rarr; B &larr; C of sets or spaces as the same type of structure.

				In a previous version of "Additivity and Fiber Sequences for Combinatorial K-Theory" from above, we also used the framework of ECGW categories to prove an analog of the Gillet--Waldhausen theorem for chain complexes of finite sets and other basic combinatorial objects. This states that chain complexes of finite sets with weak equivalences given by suitably-defined quasi-isomorphisms have an equivalent K-theory space to finite sets themselves. We are in the process of editing this result into a separate paper.

            I am interested in many different kinds of higher categorical structures, how they relate to each other, and constructions like enrichment that many of them support.

				Analyzes the algebraic structure of "physical duoidal categories" consisting of two monoidal structures that can be thought of as one juxtaposing objects in space and the other in time. Shows that structure maps between algebraic expressions in such a category can be deduced from inclusions of finite "dependency" posets, which formally means that physical duoidal categories are algebras for a "categorical operad" of those posets. This gives a visual way of determining inequalities between different (potentially complicated) expressions involving max and + for a fixed collection of nonnegative real numbers.

				Defines a general notion of enrichment for any type of higher category with a top-dimensional cell shape, and shows that enrichment forms a binary operation on higher category theories: just as enriching categories in n-categories gives (n+1)-categories, enriching type A higher categories in type B higher categories gives a new type of higher category in the sense of familial monads. Analyzes the cell shapes of nerves of higher categories and shows that those of enriched higher categories can be constructed as a generalized wreath product.

				All of the commonly studied types of high- and low-dimensional algebraic categorical structures (n-categories, double categories, multicategories, etc.) fit the definition of "familial monad algebras," which are structures built out of cells of specified shapes where certain arrangements of cells can be composed into a single cell subject to various equations. Working out a concrete characterization of the data required to define a familial monad (using some convenient properties of category-valued polynomials) allows new types of higher categories to be defined without as much work each time. For instance, cubical n-categories are easily shown to be familial monad algebras.

		  <!--
			use the language of polynomial functors to describe common constructions across the various flavors of higher categories. For instance, n-categories are algebraic structures on n-globular sets, and n-tuple categories are algebraic structures on diagrams of cubical cells which keep track of the different directions. So far, I have generalized enrichment of categories to any such higher category. In infinite dimensions, these algebraic structures can be modeled as a homotopy theory for diagrams over certain more complicated categories, like &Theta;<sub>n</sub> or products of &Delta;. My work focuses on classifying these models and establishing analogues of features of ordinary category theory (such as enrichment) for higher category theories with more general cell shapes.

		  <p>
		    Double categories together with polynomial endofunctors on the category of sets provide a rich language for describing phenomena in both category theory and real-world applications. Polynomial coalgebras model "open" dynamical systems, where the state of the system updates based on external input, and double categories of decorated/structured cospans model scientific phenomena in a way that captures compositional structure. Combinatorial spaces used in homotopy theory, namely simplicial sets, can be used to describe "partial evaluations" of algebraic expressions such as those from 1+2+3 to 3+3 or 1+5 on the way to the "total evaluation" of 6.
		  </p>
		  
		  
		  
		  
			
		  <!--<p>
		    Enrichment in a double category of polynomial coalgebras can be used to describe nested hierarchies of interacting dynamical systems, including examples from machine learning, strategic game theory, and prediction markets. Polynomial functors on the category of categories have even further potential to elegantly model structures in topology, continuous dynamics, and the theory of double categories.
		  
			I am also interested in using techniques from homotopy theory to describe computational properties of algebraic structures. For instance, in the theory of monoids, a formal expression like 1+2+3 "partially evaluates" to either 3+3 or 1+5 before reaching its "total evaluation" 6. These partial evaluations can be treated like directed paths in a space of such formal expressions in a monoid. Properties of both the theory of monoids and a particular monoid are encoded in properties of these computation spaces, which exhibit interesting and surprisingly common features of simplicial sets.
